# Shoot while moving code + simulator
## How to use:
Replace the placeholder inputs with simulated ones, guess some values for constants, and use simulated values for the actual shotspeed and angle. To run a simulation and see how accurate your turret would be, call logSim() on the shooter and copy paste it into desmos.
