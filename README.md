# Shoot while moving code + simulator
## How to use:
Replace the placeholder inputs with simulated ones, guess some values for constants, replace main with robotcontainer, and replace log(deltaTime) with periodic. To run a simulation and see how accurate your turret would be, call logSim() on the shooter and copy paste it into desmos. Right now the code is designed to run in an online java compiler because I wrote this on my school chromebook, but it should be really easy to move it into a WPI project.
